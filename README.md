# Statistical Models for Analyzing Functional Brain networks in Alzheimer's Disease
In this repository, I included the analysis models used to show that resting-state system segregation underlies cognitive reserve in Alzheimer's disease (manuscript under review). 

Several R packages were used when conducting statistical analyses:

- stats(4.4.0) was used to perform multiple linear regression. car(3.1-2) was used for conducting ANCOVA. <br>
- lme4(1.1-35.3) and lmerTest(3.1-3) were used to conducted linear-mixed effect models. <br>
- effectsize (1.0.0) was used to compute effect sizes including eta-squared and partial r. <br>
- ggplot2(3.5.1), gghalves (0.1.4), ggdist(3.3.2) were used for plotting.
