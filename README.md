# statistical models for analyzing functional brain networks in Alzheimer's disease
In this repository, I included the analysis models used to show that resting-state system segregation underlies cognitive reserve in Alzheimer's disease (manuscript under review). 

Several R packages were used when conducting statistical analyses:

stats(4.4.0) was used to perform multiple linear regression. car(3.1-2) was used for conducting ANCOVA. 
lme4(1.1-35.3) and lmerTest(3.1-3) were used to conducted linear-mixed effect models. 
Effect sizes were calculated using effectsize (1.0.0). 
ggplot2(3.5.1), gghalves (0.1.4), ggdist(3.3.2) were used for plotting.
